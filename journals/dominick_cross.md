Data displayed on plans list page.

# 29 August
Made form page for making a new plan but can't fully test until login is made. Started on edit plan page.

# 30 August
We set up frontend authentication

# 31 August
Plans was not working so we debugged all day to find out they were all async and shouldn't have been.

# 5 September
Creating a plan on the frontend is fully functional now.

# 6 September
Creating a new plan sends the user to the plans list page. Edit on plan list sends to an edit plan page form and when submitted returns the user back to the plans list page. The current plan on the list plan page (hopefully) sends the user to the plan detail page. Plans list page now shows all of the plans belonging to the logged in user.

# 7 September
Implemented error handling and added error messages for plan pages.
