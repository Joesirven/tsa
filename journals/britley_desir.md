# 7 August - 14 August
As a team, we brainstormed on our idea for this project. We then designed the wireframe 
and constructed the models/tables we would need. We also wrote our endpoints for the 
API's. I enjoyed this phase of development and seeing everyone's ideas come together, 
clash, and be resolved. 

# 15 August
We finished our last touches on our wireframe, models, and endpoints. We then began to
create the tables for a brief moment. I personally needed to watch several videos and
research references on PostgreSQL data types and creation of tables.

# 16 August
Today we finalized our models, or so we thought. We forgot a column in one of the tables
and ran into issues trying to rectify that. Today was the day I drove and it was very
informative, I learned valuable things. 

# 17 August
We started off the day redoing our database. Initially, we were going to put each table in
seperate migration files, per a suggestion, but then we decided against it. We then created
our endpoints as we followed along in the video on FastAPIs.
