# 7 August - 14 August
As a team, we brainstormed on our idea for this project. We then designed the wireframe
and constructed the models/tables we would need. We also wrote our endpoints for the
API's. I enjoyed this phase of development and seeing everyone's ideas come together,
clash, and be resolved.

# 15 August
We finished our last touches on our wireframe, models, and endpoints. We then began to
create the tables for a brief moment. I personally needed to watch several videos and
research references on PostgreSQL data types and creation of tables.

# 16 August
Today we finalized our models, or so we thought. We forgot a column in one of the tables
and ran into issues trying to rectify that. Today was the day I drove and it was very
informative, I learned valuable things.

# 17 August
We started off the day redoing our database. Initially, we were going to put each table in
seperate migration files, per a suggestion, but then we decided against it. We then created
our endpoints as we followed along in the video on FastAPIs.

# 21 August
We finished coding out our endpoints. Even though we worked together through pair programming each of us were responsible for writing out an endpoint to move things along. Were moving on to authentication.

# 22 August
Started authentication on the backend.

# 23 August
Still working on backend authentication.

# 24 August
Wrapping up authentication. We will be working on the front end separetly to keep things moving. Everyone has been assigned jobs and we will be working on that from now on. I am working on the plan detail component which comprises of savings, transactions, and expenses

# 25 August
Watching videos to see how to best approach this and taking notes.

# 28 August
Started playing around with state and getting the backend talking to the front end. Having trouble getting items to populate.

# 29 August
Watching videos and reading learn to see why I am not getting records to populate.

# 30 August
Was able to get it working. My issue was the authentication and the token.

# 31 August
Managed to get some things on the screen. Next goal is to figure out how to isolate what is populated based on the user.

# 5 September
Watched some more videos, looked up resources

# 6 September
Was able to isolate the savings to the user logged in by being passed the plan_id via params from the PlanList.

# 7 September
Realized I needed to alter the routes so that savings/transactions were created simultaneously with a plan

# 8 September
Finished up with the logic behind savings/transactions. Wanted current_amount_saved to reflect all the transactions that were saved.

# 11 September
Making unit tests
